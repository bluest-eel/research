    "\n",
    "We're exploring tiles of width $2^n$, where $n \\geqslant 1$ (since tiles of width $2^0$ are just single cells). Powers of 2 are both practical for scaling purposes as well as making the math easier.  With cells making up tiles, we'll also look at collections of tiles; these too will have widths of powers of two, namely $2^m$. We'll spend most of our time working with the case $m=2$, since that's enough tiles two explore all possible interactions. Here's a visual of $m = 0$, $m = 1$, and $m = 2$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The example above shows tiles with borders; furthermore, it highlights where those borders may have interaction with other tiles, and what type of interactions. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <font color=\"#C27BA0\" size=\"10px\">&#9632;</font> Cells with this colour are conflcit-free, contention-free zone: they will never have shared data for time steps  $t + 1$.\n",
    "* <font color=\"#6D9EEB\" size=\"10px\">&#9632;</font> Cells with this colour are part of a tile's outer border. Since they are part of the outer border, with no overlap with cells of other tiles, they can only be considered temporarily conflict-free. This is due to the fact that the tiles could be moved or other tiles could be placed against their borders. As such, at every time step, we should check if a new tile has been placed adjacent; if not, we may continue to regard it as conflict-free for time steps  $t + 1$.\n",
    "* <font color=\"#3C78D8\" size=\"10px\">&#9632;</font> Dark blue cells are outer border cells of a tile that are adjacent to other tiles's outer border cells and could have shared data between two cells of two different tiles for time steps $t + 1$.\n",
    "* <font color=\"#8E7CC3\" size=\"10px\">&#9632;</font> Light purple cells are non-outer border cells of two adjacent tiless' non-outer border cells and could have shared data between two cells of two different tiles for time steps $t + 1$.\n",
    "* <font color=\"#674EA7\" size=\"10px\">&#9632;</font> Dark purple cells are non-outer border cells of four adjacent tiles' non-outer border cells and could have shared data between fours cells of four different tiles for time steps $t + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that if we split up an agent-based world into tiles, how much processing in those tiles can be done independently of the others, and how much will need to be coordinated? If a model is running across a collection of tiles and time $t_0$ is the initial state, then at $t_1$, the most any tile's agents could make it into another tile would be around the perimater of the tile to a depth of one cell. It is in this case (where agent data has moved from one tile to another) that coordination is required between the work being done on tiles; conversely,  agents who remain in a given tile don't need to have their work coordinated.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tile Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each tile has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cell dimentions: $2^n$ by $2^n$\n",
    "* Total number of cells: $2^n \\times 2^n$\n",
    "* Number of inner cells: $(2^n - 2) \\times (2^n - 2)$\n",
    "* Number of border cells: $2^n \\times 2^n - ((2^n - 2) \\times (2^n - 2))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections of tiles follow the same rules, and as such, have the same properies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tile set dimentions: $2^m$ by $2^m$\n",
    "* Total number of tiles in a set: $2^m \\times 2^m$\n",
    "* Number of inner tiles: $(2^m - 2) \\times (2^m - 2)$\n",
    "* Number of border tiles: $2^m \\times 2^m - ((2^m - 2) \\times (2^m - 2))$\n",

Then we'll explore possible solutions to the distributed coordination problem.\n",

    "* We could have a naïve messaging system: \n",
    "  * Generate a message every time a cell changes (e.g., an agent enters or leaves a cell).\n",
    "  * Neighboring tiles would only need to subscribe to changes in the border cells of the adjacent tiles.\n",
    "  * Tiles would only need to pay attention to these change messages if there was an agent in a neighboring cell of their own border zone.\n",

    "\n",
    "<a name=\"lockingimpl\">1</a>: It might be a good idea to have a locking implementation, just to having something to compare to. See https://gobyexample.com/mutexes and  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55196635/when-to-use-mutexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"cspimpl\">2</a>: If we do a locking example, we should also do a CSP example. See https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating and https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"immutimpl\">3</a>: See, for example, https://github.com/tobgu/peds/. Immutable data structures are not supported natively in Go; would need to see some compelling benchmarks and a good use case to pursue this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"neighborhooddef\">4</a>: For the Game of Life, as previously mentioned, the naïve definition of neighboring cells is used: those eight cells immediately adjacent to (surrounding) a given cell. However, we need to be flexible here, due to the fact that different agent-based models will have potentially wildly varying definitions of neighborhood. Consider the possibility that models could want the nearest $n$ cells, an actual radius (for discrete cells, this would have to be approximated, but it wouldn't produce the same results as nearst $n$ cells), nearst $n$ agents, all agents within a given radius, agents or cells within a function of distance (as opposed to scalar values for distance), or even proximity over time. Note, too, that the definition of a border zone is ultimately dependent upon the definition of a neighborhood: for all cells that border another tile, the definition of neighborhood needs to be applied, and any cells qualifying as neighbors according to that definition, comprise the border zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"metadata\">5</a>: We don't actually want to store metadata in the data structure representing the cells/agents. The presence of an agent in a cell will potentially be highly dynamic, changing a great deal and in all likelihood can be representing with a single on/off bit, so could be very compact. Non-state metadata, however, could potentially be very verbose and is typically also static in nature; thus, it would be a waste to store this in a data structure that it optimized for small, rapidly changing bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"quadtree\">6</a>: Quadtrees will probably not be much use in our case. If, however, we eventually care about varying scales in large tiles, it would become a pertinent option.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"rtree\">7</a>: R-trees could be useful for grouping agents in agent-based models that have more sophisticated definitions of neighborhood than the Game of Life model does.\n",
